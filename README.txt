The project was completed in a team with all of the team members working on header file major1.h and major1.c file. 
Each of us included our respective function declaration in our common header file.
Each of us completed our assigned c member files individually as detailed below.

Aashish worked on rotate.c, a file with a function to rotate the given unsigned integer by a given amount of value for rotation.

Bikesh worked on endian.c, a file with a function to swap two middle bytes with each other and two bytes in extremity with each other to change endian order.

Binu worked on clz.c, a file with a function to count leading number of zeros in a given unsigned integer.

Sharan worked on parity.c, a file with a function to perform parity computation with output being 0 for even parity and 1 for odd parity.

To compile and run the program just use the makefile which is already created. For that just type make and press enter. In the next step, just type make run and 
press enter.

Thank you.
